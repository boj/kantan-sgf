~~ ABOUT ~~~~~*

KANTAN means "simple" in Japanese.

Due to the lack of standalone Ruby SGF parsers,
I ended up writing this project to help with a
few other side projects.  Hopefully it benefits
other people interested in using Ruby for their
SGF parsing related projects.

It doesn't do node parsing (yet).  
I just upgraded it using Treetop grammar
to parse the file, so a good majority of
the data is pulled out now.  Some of it
will get refined with more internal handling,
but for now enjoy!

~~ Requirements ~~~~~*

Requires the Treetop gem to run.

  $ gem install treetop

~~ USAGE ~~~~~*

You pretty much run it like so:

  # Load and parse
	sgf = KantanSgf::Sgf.new('data/stoic-bojo.sgf')
	sgf.parse
	
	# Pull back properties
	puts sgf.player_black
	puts sgf.player_white
	puts sgf.komi
	puts sgf.result
	
	# do some magic with the move hash
	for move in sgf.move_list
		puts "%s: (%i, %i)" % [move[:color], move[:x], move[:y]]
	end
	
Note that the move data is stored as:
 * move: The current move number
 * color: 'B' or 'W'
 * x, y:  Integer value from 0..board_size - 1
 * time: Clock time left
 * ot_stones: Overtime stones
 * pass: true

Properties can be accessed directly via
sgf.properties["prop_name"].

Comments can be access via
sgf.comments # {:move, :data}
