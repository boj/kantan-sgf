	<strong>Q: What does "kantan" mean?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	A: "kantan" is the word for <em>simple</em> in the Japanese language.
	I chose this word since it relates to the project (<em>Simple</em> Game Format),
	and as a student of Japanese I enjoy using the language's words.

	<strong>Q: Why did you make kantan-sgf?</strong>
</p>

<p>
	A: There seemed to be a complete lack of standalone Ruby SGF parsers,
	and a few of my other projects required such a tool.  I finally broke
	down and wrote one, which turned into a good exercise on Treetop grammar
	usage, gem building, etc.
