~~ ABOUT ~~~~~*

KANTAN means "simple" or "easy" in
that wacky Japanese language.

There doesn't seem to be any such
thing as a dedicated Ruby SGF project.
I know because I've been looking for 
a few years.  

If I missed one, sorry.

Anyways, I got sick of searching around, 
and an SGF parser applies to the
project I am working on, so I broke down
and wrote this.

It doesn't do node parsing, it doesn't
return half the properties (yet).  
It's actually a super bare bones parser, 
and not that great.

However, if you just want to do some
basic SGF parsing this is the project
for you!

~~ USAGE ~~~~~*

You pretty much run it like so:

  # Load and parse
	sgf = Sgf.new('data/game-01.sgf')
	sgf.parse
	
	# Pull back properties
	puts sgf.player_black
	puts sgf.player_white
	puts sgf.komi
	puts sgf.result
	
	# do some magic with the move hash
	for move in sgf.move_list
		puts "%s: (%i, %i)" % [move[:color], move[:x], move[:y]]
	end
	
Note that the move data is stored as:
 * color: 'B' or 'W'
 * x, y:  Integer value from 0..board_size
