~~ ABOUT ~~~~~*

KANTAN means "simple" or "easy" in
that wacky Japanese language.

There doesn't seem to be any such
thing as a dedicated Ruby SGF project.
I know because I've been looking for 
a few years.  

If I missed one, sorry.

Anyways, I got sick of searching around, 
and an SGF parser applies to the
project I am working on, so I broke down
and wrote this.

It doesn't do node parsing (yet).  
I just upgraded it using Treetop grammar
to parse the file, so a good majority of
the data is pulled out now.  Some of it
will get refined with more internal handling,
but for now enjoy!

~~ Requirements ~~~~~*

Requires the Treetop gem to run.

  $ gem install treetop

~~ USAGE ~~~~~*

You pretty much run it like so:

  # Load and parse
	sgf = KantanSgf::Sgf.new('data/stoic-bojo.sgf')
	sgf.parse
	
	# Pull back properties
	puts sgf.player_black
	puts sgf.player_white
	puts sgf.komi
	puts sgf.result
	
	# do some magic with the move hash
	for move in sgf.move_list
		puts "%s: (%i, %i)" % [move[:color], move[:x], move[:y]]
	end
	
Note that the move data is stored as:
 * color: 'B' or 'W'
 * x, y:  Integer value from 0..board_size - 1
 * time: Clock time left
 * ot_stones: Overtime stones
